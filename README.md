 # Contour detection over a punch card image
This Xcode playground is based on the example showed by Frank Doepke, Apple engineer, on the WWDC'2020 talk named "[Explore Computer Vision APIs](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10673)".

It shows how to perform contour detection over a punch card image, applying a couple of `CIFilter`s to reduce the number of contours of interest.
